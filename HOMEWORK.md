## Setup Rails API application

```bash
unzip fh-homework-AB-MM.DD.YYYY.zip
mv fh-homework-AB-MM.DD.YYYY fh-homework-AB
cd fh-homework-AB
git init
git add .
git commit -am 'Initial commit'
git checkout -b part-01-initial-api
```

Note: The solution for this homework should exist within the branch,
`part-01-initial-api`.

## Using TDD

You will be using RSpec request specs to test your API and your files for the
spec and implementation will reside in the following folders:

- spec folder

  ```bash
  spec/requests/api/players_controller_spec.rb
  ```

- implementation folder

  ```bash
  app/controllers/api/players_controller.rb
  ```

- running all specs

  ```
  $ rspec
  ```

  Note: Do not type `$` in the above. Just the command that follows.

  You are done when the above command generates the similar output:

  ```bash
  $ bundle exec rspec
  .........

  Finished in 0.22576 seconds (files took 1.13 seconds to load)
  9 examples, 0 failures
  ```

- running a specific spec

  ```bash
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:6 # API::PlayersController GET /players retrieves all the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:25 # API::PlayersController GET /players/:id with valid params retrieves the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:43 # API::PlayersController GET /players/:id with invalid params retrieves the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:59 # API::PlayersController POST /players with valid params creates a new Player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:80 # API::PlayersController POST /players with invalid params creates a new player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:99 # API::PlayersController PUT /players/:id with valid params updates the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:119 # API::PlayersController PUT /players/:id with invalid params updates the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:141 # API::PlayersController DELETE /players/:id with valid params destroys the requested player
  rspec ./spec/controllers/api/players_controller_spec.rb:161 # API::PlayersController DELETE /players/:id with invalid params destroys the requested player
  ```

## Generate Fake Data

- Use a Ruby gem called `faker` to generate 50 players

  - add the logic to your `seeds.rb` file for creating the player models

## Deliverables

- create Github repository called `fh-homework-10`

  Note: Follow the instructions for connecting your local repository to the Github repository.

- push changes to Github

  ```bash
  cd fh-homework-10
  git checkout part-01-initial-api
  git push
  ```

- merge changes into the master branch and push to Github

  ```bash
  cd fh-homework-10
  git checkout master
  git merge part-01-initial-api
  git push
  ```
